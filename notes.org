* Ideas to possibly incorporate
+ Subtypes for structured editing
+ Dependencies
+ Name equiv => 2-iso?
+ Subobject/subtype?
+ Resource limits/caps
+ Value-like resources (e.g. hash serialization)
+ Custom dir repr?
+ Dir/regular file links?
+ Late binding refs (part of pitch to Nix world?)
+ Within-exe hash changes
+ In-progress:
  + immutable stream-file in progress (EOF â‰  done)
  + Directory load
+ command-not-foudn
* TODO Figures
* TODO Links
* TODO Review/editing/cleanup
* TODO The implementation
Elvysh provides several core components to make this model real:

+ *Interfaces* include protocols between namespaces (or between the user and namespaces), 

+ GC
+ Centralize reductions/per user
+ Lazy/incomplete
+ Value-like resources
+ Pull/push
+ Provisional results
+ Scheduler/resource optimization/global optimization
+ Priority queue caps
+ Well-known projections
+ Naming
  + Hashing vs authoritative name server, what to hash
+ Trusted ns vs root ns
