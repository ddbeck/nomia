* What is Nomia?

Nomia is inspired by tools such as Nix, Unison, and Git. They all provide distinct, immutable names for resources like packages, code, and files. Nomia wants to bring them together (and more!) to make reproducing whole environments—from your editor to code to data to complete running services—as easy as ~git switch~.

Nomia's a growing project and we want you to help shape it. [[https://discord.gg/mSc4yXF2RV][Join us on our Discord server]] or [[#community][attend a pairing session]].

To learn more about Nomia in general, check out these resources:

- For a high-level introduction to how Nomia works, read [[./INTRODUCTION.org]].

To begin developing Nomia, read:

- [[https://about.scarf.sh/post/announcing-nomia-and-the-scarf-environment-manager][Announcing Nomia and the Scarf Environment Manager]], which introduces Nomia and how it relates it to [[https://about.scarf.sh][Scarf]]'s mission and related work.

*See also:* The [[https://github.com/scarf-sh/scarf][Scarf CLI]] is currently implemented on top of an internal prototype of basic Nomia capabilities. These will be reimplemented as standalone components (likely in Rust) and moved into this repository.
