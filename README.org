#+TITLE: Nomia

A universal resource manager for package management, build systems and more

* Introduction
Nomia provides a systematic mechanism for giving names to any kind of resource, composing those names together to identify new composite resources, and acquiring access to the resources thus identified. These capabilities allow for precise, efficient resource management, all using a single unified abstraction applicable across domains.

There are other systems that provide similar capabilities. [[https://nixos.org/][Nix]] provides mechanisms to identify packages by their exact build steps and the inputs they rely on, enabling fully reproducible package management with efficient sharing of common dependencies between builds and systems. [[https://www.unisonweb.org/][Unison]] provides mechanisms to identify immutable pieces of code by content, allowing precise code dependency management, distributed computation, and a transparent automatic compilation model. [[https://git-scm.com/][Git]] provides mechanisms to identify files, filesystem trees, and source control artifacts like commits and tags by their content, enabling distributed source control with efficient sharing and transmission of changes. Inspired by these and similar systems, Nomia starts with these notions of identifying, combining, distributing, and creating resources by name, and builds upon them by:

- Allowing arbitrary kinds of resources to be identified within the system and combined. Nomia can handle packages, services, pieces of code, entire data centers, individual time-slices of CPU workâ€”any type of resource you can work with.
- Enabling domain-specific notions of the precision and semantics of names to coexist. Nomia names can capture identifications as precise as "the build of the Acme webserver from revision ~b7397db~ built inside a fresh docker container based on ~ubuntu@sha256:6e9f67fa63b0323e9a1e587fd71c561ba48a034504fb804fd26fd8800039835d~" or as loose as "the latest version of the user's favorite browser, either cross-compiled or native-compiled to target ARMv8", and combine them together.
- Having a first-class representation of relationships /between/ names; identifying refinements of resource names; and enabling efficient reuse of existing resources, resource storage mechanisms, and resource creation mechanisms. A name which specifies "the latest version of the user's favorite browser, either cross-compiled or native-compiled to target ARMv8" might, at a particular invocation, /reduce to/ "firefox 87.0 cross-compiled from amd64 linux", which we may have already built or already know how to build.

In the Nomia-powered future, you will be able to:

1. Point your editor to ~(client-projects:acme):server//src/main.cc~ and have the latest version of the Acme server source code downloaded to your machine, the ~main.cc~ file opened, and the dependencies loaded for use by your editor's code checker.
2. Make a change and point your browser to ~nomia://(client-projects:acme):server/login~ and have the Acme server built (reusing the results of the latest CI build for unchanged files), the service and its dependencies started, and the login page for your local instance loaded into your browser.
3. Tell your deployment tool to modify the staging environment with the replacement ~acme-server => (client-projects:acme):server~ and have the local ~(client-projects:acme):server~ automatically reduced to the more deterministic ~cmake:c++-project(input: immutable-filesystem-object?hash=9368819aaf6f619ec109e544b56ca05a21375ca671d00dbf7532e0b69aded39a)~ and the results shipped off to your staging environment with all downstream dependencies pointing to your changed service.

Behind the scenes of each step, Nomia will be driving name resolution and resource acquisition.

# TODO the gif story should go here, maybe replacing the previous 3 step description

* Documentation
Nomia is in early active development, and we are fleshing out the documentation as we go. For now, the following resources are available:

- The [[https://github.com/scarf-sh/nomia/releases/download/1.1/nomia-whitepaper.pdf][Deep Dive Into Nomia]] paper expands on the motivation for and the conceptual model underlying Nomia in detail.
- This [[https://about.scarf.sh/post/announcing-nomia-and-the-scarf-environment-manager][blog post]] announces Nomia, and relates it to [[https://about.scarf.sh][Scarf]]'s mission and related work.
- The [[https://github.com/scarf-sh/scarf][Scarf CLI]] is currently implemented on top of an internal prototype of basic Nomia capabilities. These will be reimplemented as standalone components (likely in Rust) and moved into this repository.
